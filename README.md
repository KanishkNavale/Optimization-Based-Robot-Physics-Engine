# Optimization Based Robot Physics Engine
This repository implements an optimization strategy for singularity free trajectory generation for serial robot.
Also, implements numerical stable math for Inverse Kinematics & Dynamics estimation.

## Robot Functionalities
1. Move the in Joint, Linear & Circular Path.
2. Circular Path needs 3-Points for trajectory generation.
3. Actively avoids Singularity in Planned Path.
4. Teleoperation based on Keyboard.

## Codebase Structure
1. [core](core): Implements the core math for the robot.
2. [forge](forge): Holds simulator script.
3. [model](model): Contains the .urdf files of the robot.
4. [demos](demos): Description on how to use the robot.
